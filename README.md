# ATM-API

You have just stumbled upon a Golden ATM. You have the ability to withdraw money from any account you can access. The only problem is, you need to know a specific id to login to someone's account. 

You know there are three users that potentially have a lot of money stored in this Bank. One of them is a superhuman hero that swings around cities and saves the innocent. Another is the chosen one, a powerful wizard, the boy who lived. And the other is some guy that plays with model rockets and cars and stuff.

In order to complete this challenge, you need to tell the judges the maximum amount of money you can steal from one person's account at this ATM. We promise you won't get caught. Paste your answer in the meeting chat. 

THE ONE RULE FOR THIS CHALLENGE: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ACCESS THE DATABASE DIRECTLY. EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE WITH THE API ENDPOINTS IN THIS REPOSITORY.
